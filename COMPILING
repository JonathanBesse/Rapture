Requires Visual Studio 2013 or later.
You will need to download dirent.h and place it in your Visual Studio include folder (normally found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include)
All you need to do then is compile the game under Debug or Release (it works in both) and it should run. The game assets and redistributable game content will be placed in C:\Rapture\Gamedata.
NOTE: You may need to copy fonts from your cloned/zipped copy of the repository to your game folder, as Windows has special restrictions on .ttf files.
