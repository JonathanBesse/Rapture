Rapture
=======

Rapture is (or will be) a fresh spin on the tried-and-true genre of hack-and-slash ARPG genre. This project was started in the realization that there aren't very many quality games in this genre, and Clint Bellanger's FLARE engine had some glaring design problems which I feel hold it back. Instead, I decided to write my own game and engine from scratch, using SDL 2.0 as a backbone for the game.

I'm always open to outside contributions and suggestions. I will be hiring professional artists when the full game is fleshed out, and basic game programming is done. I haven't yet decided on a license; I feel as though the GPL is optimal, but it unfortunately doesn't play nice with Awesomium's licensing terms.

The game is written in C++, while menus are done in HTML/CSS/JS. Minigames such as lockpicking, etc will be coded in JavaScript. It is designed to be a game that is easily and comprehensibly moddable.

= Compiling =

Please read the COMPILING document for information on compiling. Currently the project is set up for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010/Windows, but I've designed the code to manage other OSes just fine. I plan on utilizing CMake when a proper Mac/Linux port is in the crosshairs.


= Team Management =

Currently I'm coding this on my own, but I'd like to set up a team to work on this?
