Requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or later.
All you need to do currently is open the Rapture/Rapture.sln file with Visual Studio. It'll currently output files to C:\Rapture\Gamedata. You'll need to copy some files from your clone to this directory:
- Entire "core" folder (game assets) from Rapture/
- All .dll files from SDL/lib/x86/
- All files from awesomium/lib/ (except awesomium.lib)

It may take a few seconds longer to load on first run, due to browser caching taking place. It works on Debug and Release builds (+debugging using VS), but doesn't support Edit and Continue for the modcode or the editor projects.
